# Performance and Indexing Requirements

## Overview
The system must provide optimal performance through strategic indexing and efficient database design to support high-volume operations and fast query response times.

## Requirements

• **REQ-PERF-001**: The system shall provide optimized query performance through strategic indexing on frequently accessed columns

• **REQ-PERF-002**: The system shall enforce uniqueness constraints on business-critical fields like activity codes and request codes

• **REQ-PERF-003**: The system shall support efficient lookups of authorization records by job number, user, and activity combinations

## Database Implementation
- Strategic indexes: 
  - Unique index on `Activity.ActivityCode`
  - Unique index on `AccessRequest.RequestCode`
  - Composite unique index on `Authorization` (JobNumber, UserId, ActivityId)
  - Composite unique index on `GroupAuthorization` (JobNumber, GroupId, ActivityId)
- Performance optimization: Clustered indexes on primary keys, non-clustered indexes on lookup columns
- Query optimization: Indexes designed to support common query patterns and join operations
