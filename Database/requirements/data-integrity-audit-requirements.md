# Data Integrity and Audit Requirements

## Overview
The system must maintain comprehensive data integrity and provide complete audit capabilities to ensure data consistency, reliability, and regulatory compliance.

## Requirements

• **REQ-DI-001**: The system shall maintain referential integrity between all related tables through foreign key constraints

• **REQ-DI-002**: The system shall use UTC timestamps consistently for all temporal data to ensure timezone-independent operations

• **REQ-DI-003**: The system shall support audit trails by capturing created/updated timestamps and user identifiers

• **REQ-DI-004**: The system shall use identity columns for primary keys to ensure unique record identification

• **REQ-DI-005**: The system shall support both individual user and group-based authorization models simultaneously

## Database Implementation
- Foreign key constraints: Comprehensive referential integrity across all related tables
- Temporal data: All timestamps stored in UTC format
- Audit fields: `UtcCreatedAt`, `CreatedByNum`, `UtcUpdatedAt`, `UpdatedByNum` where applicable
- Primary keys: Identity columns used consistently across all tables
- Concurrent models: Separate but related authorization tables for users and groups
