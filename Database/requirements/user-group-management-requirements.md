# User Group Management Requirements

## Overview
The system must provide user group management capabilities to organize users into logical groups for simplified permission administration and role-based access control.

## Requirements

• **REQ-UG-001**: The system shall have a **UserGroup** table so that users can be organized into logical groups for permission management

• **REQ-UG-002**: The system shall support group ownership through a GroupOwner field to identify who manages each group

• **REQ-UG-003**: The system shall have a **UserGroupMember** table so that many-to-many relationships between users and groups can be maintained

• **REQ-UG-004**: The system shall support cascading deletion of group memberships when groups are deleted

## Database Implementation
- Primary tables: `UserGroup`, `UserGroupMember`
- Key fields:
  - `UserGroup`: `GroupId`, `GroupName`, `Description`, `GroupOwner`
  - `UserGroupMember`: `GroupId`, `UserId`
- Constraints: 
  - Primary key on `GroupId` for UserGroup
  - Composite primary key on `GroupId` and `UserId` for UserGroupMember
- Foreign keys: `UserGroupMember` references `UserGroup` with cascade delete
