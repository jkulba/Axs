# Blazor WASM NGINX Podman Project

This project demonstrates how to host a Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) application using NGINX within a Podman pod. It includes the necessary configuration files and instructions to set up the environment.

## Project Structure

- `nginx/default.conf`: NGINX configuration file for hosting the Blazor WASM application.
- `nginx/mime.types`: MIME types used by NGINX to serve Blazor WASM application files.
- `blazor-app/`: Directory containing the output files generated by building the Blazor WASM application.
- `podman/podman-instructions.md`: Instructions for creating a Podman pod that contains the Blazor WASM app hosted in NGINX.
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile to build the NGINX image for hosting the Blazor WASM application.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Build the Blazor WASM Application**: Ensure you have built your Blazor WASM application and the output files are placed in the `blazor-app` directory.

2. **Configure NGINX**: The `nginx/default.conf` file is set up to serve the Blazor application. Ensure it points to the correct root directory where your Blazor app files are located.

3. **Build the Docker Image**: Use the provided Dockerfile to build the NGINX image.

   ```bash
   podman build -t blazor-nginx .
   ```

4. **Create and Run the Pod**: Follow the instructions in `podman/podman-instructions.md` to create and run the Podman pod.

## Usage

After setting up the pod, you can access your Blazor WASM application by navigating to the appropriate URL in your web browser.
