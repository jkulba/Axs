# Code Coverage Configuration Guide

## 📊 Human-Readable Coverage Reports Setup Complete!

### 🔧 What's Been Configured

#### **1. Coverage Collection (coverlet.runsettings)**
- **Multiple formats**: Cobertura, OpenCover, JSON
- **Smart exclusions**: Test files, generated code, compiler-generated code
- **Optimized settings**: Skip auto-properties, deterministic builds
- **Source linking**: Better file path resolution

#### **2. Human-Readable Report Generation**
- **HTML Reports**: Full interactive coverage browser
- **Summary Reports**: Quick overview with key metrics
- **Badges**: Visual coverage indicators
- **Text Summary**: Console-friendly output
- **Markdown Summary**: README-compatible format
- **SVG Charts**: Visual coverage charts
- **JSON Data**: Machine-readable for integrations

#### **3. Multi-Stage Coverage Analysis**

##### **Stage 1: Build & Test Job**
- Collects raw coverage data during test execution
- Generates basic HTML reports
- Displays coverage summary in console
- Uploads coverage artifacts

##### **Stage 2: Code Quality Job**
- Downloads coverage data from build job
- Generates detailed analysis reports
- Creates comprehensive coverage history
- Prepares PR comments with coverage data
