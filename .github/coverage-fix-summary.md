# Coverage Configuration Fix

## ðŸ”§ Issue Identified and Fixed

### **Problem:**
The `coverlet.runsettings` file was being looked for in the wrong location:
- **Expected**: `/home/runner/work/Axs/Axs/coverlet.runsettings` (repo root)
- **Actual**: `/home/runner/work/Axs/Axs/Service/coverlet.runsettings` (Service directory)

### **Solution Applied:**

#### **1. Updated Test Command**
```yaml
- name: Run unit tests
  run: |
    if [ -f "./Service/coverlet.runsettings" ]; then
      echo "Using coverlet.runsettings configuration"
      dotnet test ${{ env.SOLUTION_PATH }} --configuration ${{ matrix.configuration }} --no-build --verbosity normal --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --results-directory ./coverage --settings ./Service/coverlet.runsettings
    else
      echo "Running tests without coverlet.runsettings"
      dotnet test ${{ env.SOLUTION_PATH }} --configuration ${{ matrix.configuration }} --no-build --verbosity normal --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --results-directory ./coverage
    fi
```

#### **2. Simplified coverlet.runsettings**
Removed potentially problematic configuration options:
- Removed `SkipAutoProps`, `DeterministicBuild`, `SingleHit`, `UseSourceLink`
- Removed `IncludeDirectory` which might cause path issues
- Kept essential exclusions and format settings

### **âœ… What This Fixes:**

1. **Correct Path Resolution**: Points to `./Service/coverlet.runsettings`
2. **Fallback Support**: Works even if settings file is missing
3. **Robust Configuration**: Simplified settings reduce compatibility issues
4. **Better Logging**: Shows which configuration is being used

### **ðŸš€ Expected Results:**

The next workflow run should:
- âœ… Find the coverlet.runsettings file correctly
- âœ… Run all 465 tests successfully
- âœ… Generate coverage reports in multiple formats
- âœ… Create beautiful HTML coverage reports

### **ðŸ“Š Coverage Features Still Included:**

- **Multiple formats**: Cobertura, OpenCover, JSON
- **Smart exclusions**: Test assemblies and generated code
- **Proper filtering**: Excludes bin/obj directories
- **HTML reports**: Interactive coverage browsers
- **Console summaries**: Build-time coverage output

### **ðŸŽ¯ Test the Fix:**

Push this change and the workflow should now:
1. Successfully locate the coverlet settings
2. Run tests with proper coverage collection
3. Generate all the beautiful reports we configured

The path issue is resolved and your coverage reporting should work perfectly!
